# neighborhood-map

This is project 5 in my Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

The challange:
Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
